# Req - Res App with SWIFT-UI


Reqres_SwiftUI is a simple iOS app built using Swift and SwiftUI to demonstrate how to consume a REST API using the popular Swift networking library, Alamofire.

The app connects to the Reqres.in API, which provides a simple REST API for testing and prototyping. The app allows users to browse the list of available users and view their details, including their name, avatar, and email address.

The code is structured in a modular and reusable way, making it easy to understand and extend. This app can serve as a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn how to use Alamofire with Swift to consume REST APIs.
