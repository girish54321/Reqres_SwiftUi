# Reqres_SwiftUI

Reqres_SwiftUI is a simple iOS app built using Swift and SwiftUI to demonstrate how to consume a REST API using the popular Swift networking library, Alamofire.

The app connects to the Reqres.in API, which provides a simple REST API for testing and prototyping. The app allows users to browse the list of available users and view their details, including their name, avatar, and email address.
